# _SPACE X_ Launch Forecasting App 

## Purpose: 
 Project Gemini is an app that allows users to search for upcoming Space-X launches and check the weather forecast for said launches with in a 7 day window of launch day.
### It can also: 
* Let users search for information of past launches i.e, launch date, serial number of rocket, how many times the booster was used, images of the launch etc. 
* Let users track the location of _StarMan_ and answer the age old question, where is the roadster? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ‚òÄÔ∏è
